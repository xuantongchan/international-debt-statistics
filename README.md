# international-debt-analysis
A short project by a guided SQL learning module on **DataCamp** to extract meaningful insights from international finance data. 

## 📊 Project Overview (from DataCamp)

Humans often take debt to meet personal needs — and countries do too. Debt is a major tool used by governments to fund infrastructure, social development, and economic growth. In this project, we examine a dataset published by The World Bank containing information on **international debt statistics**.

Qeustions answered using SQL:
1. How many **distinct countries** are present in the dataset?
2. Which country has the **highest total debt**?
3. Which country has the **lowest total principal repayment**?

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Inside
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `international_debt.csv` | International debt database used |
| `international_debt_statistics.sql` | Gaining insight on the database provided  |
| `README.md` | You're here! |

## 🚀 What I Practised
- Understanding macroeconomic datasets and debt indicators
- Using `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to find unique entries
- Summing values with `SUM()` for aggregated insights
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering using `WHERE`
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY` and limiting output using `LIMIT`
- Applying column aliases for clean, interpretable output
- Drawing conclusions from financial data in a structured way

Thanks for stopping by! ⭐️
